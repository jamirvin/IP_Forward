Build instructions. 

Use the included makefile with the default target.

> make

Usage: ./ipforward <Forwarding table> <ip packets> <output file>



Everything seems to work pretty well according to the requirements.
Once possible shortcoming is that because I read in and store the
entire packets file at a time it could fail for exceptionally large
packet files. If I needed to handle those or this was reading from 
a socket I would reorganize to have it handle each packet as it is 
read.
